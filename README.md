## React Boilerplate

This is a react boilerplate codebase built off of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to get you started quicker. It includes ESLint setup with recommended react settings and Prettier installed for correct automatic formatting along with SASS for SCSS.

Additionally, react-router has been added in for a more component driven implementation which will allow you to add multiple components/pages relatively easily and quickly should you so desire.

### Getting Started

In order to get started, you must install all the dependencies locally by running

#### `npm install`

Once you have done this, you can get it started by running

#### `npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode (with hot reloading).

You can then view it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser.
